 Welcome to my **CodSoft Internship** Repository!<br><br>
This repository documents my journey and project work throughout my **Artificial Intelligence** internship at CodSoft.<br>
During this internship, I have the opportunity to work on real-world AI tasks, explore cutting-edge techniques, and build hands-on experience.<br>
The projects here reflect my progress and learning in the field of AI.
<br><br>
As part of the internship, I was assigned five key tasks, spanning different AI domains such as natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision.<br>
These tasks allow me to apply various AI concepts in practical settings.
<br><br>
**Assigned Tasks:**
<br><br>
**1.Rule-Based Chatbot:** Implementing a conversational AI system using predefined rules and patterns.
<br>
**2.Tic-Tac-Toe AI:** Developing an AI that can play the classic game using decision-making algorithms.
<br>
**3.Image Captioning:** Using deep learning to automatically generate descriptions for images.
<br>
**4.Recommendation System:** Building a system that provides personalized suggestions based on user preferences.
<br>
**5.Face Detection & Recognition:** Implementing AI to detect and recognize faces in images or video streams.
<br><br>
Each project showcases different AI techniques and tools, aimed at solving real-world problems using innovative machine learning and computer vision methods.<br>
This repository will continue to evolve as I work through these tasks and share my progress along the way.
