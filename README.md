Welcome to my **CodSoft Internship** Repository!
This repository documents my journey and project work throughout my **Artificial Intelligence** internship at CodSoft.
During this internship, I have the opportunity to work on real-world AI tasks, explore cutting-edge techniques, and build hands-on experience.
The projects here reflect my progress and learning in the field of AI.

As part of the internship, I was assigned five key tasks, spanning different AI domains such as natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision. 
These tasks allow me to apply various AI concepts in practical settings.

**Assigned Tasks:**

**1.Rule-Based Chatbot:** Implementing a conversational AI system using predefined rules and patterns.

**2.Tic-Tac-Toe AI:** Developing an AI that can play the classic game using decision-making algorithms.

**3.Image Captioning:** Using deep learning to automatically generate descriptions for images.

**4.Recommendation System:** Building a system that provides personalized suggestions based on user preferences.

**5.Face Detection & Recognition:** Implementing AI to detect and recognize faces in images or video streams.

Each project showcases different AI techniques and tools, aimed at solving real-world problems using innovative machine learning and computer vision methods.
This repository will continue to evolve as I work through these tasks and share my progress along the way.
