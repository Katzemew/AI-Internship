# Image Captioning
 Welcome to the Image Captioning folder! This project aims to automatically generate descriptive captions for given images using deep learning techniques. 
 
 Imagine showing a computer a picture of a cat playing with a ball, and it accurately describes it as "A cat is playing with a red ball in a living room." That's what we're building here!
 
 This README file will guide you through the project's purpose, how to set it up, use it, and understand it's core components.
 
 *  **FeaturesImage Preprocessing**: Prepare images for neural network input.Text Preprocessing: Tokenize and vectorize captions.
 * **Feature Extraction**: Use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract visual features from images.
 * **Caption Generation**: Employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically an LSTM, to generate sequential captions based on image features.
 * **Model Training**: Train the combined CNN-RNN model on a dataset of images and their corresponding captions.Inference: Generate captions for new, unseen images.
 
 ## 🛠️ Technologies Used
 * **Python**: The primary programming language.
 * **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
 * **Numpy**: For numerical operations.Pandas: For data manipulation (if needed for dataset handling).
 * **Matplotlib**: For visualization (e.g., plotting training history).
 * **Pillow (PIL)**: For image loading and manipulation.
 
 ## 🚀 Setup and Installation
 To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:
 1. Clone the Repository: `git clone <https://github.com/Katzemew/AI-Internship.git>`

2. `cd TASK_3`

3. Create a Virtual Environment : `python -m venv venv`

---
## Running On Windows

1. **Activating virtual environment**: `venv\Scripts\activate`. Using a virtual environment helps manage project dependencies without conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

2. **Install Dependencies**:pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib pillow.This command installs all the necessary Python libraries.

3. **Download Dataset**:You'll need a dataset of images and their captions. A popular choice is the Flickr8k dataset or MS COCO dataset. For this project, we'll primarily focus on the Flickr8k dataset due to its manageable size for learning purposes.

4. **Flickr8k Dataset**: You can typically find it on Kaggle or directly from academic sources. Download the image folder and the Flickr8k.token.txt file.

Place the downloaded dataset files in a data/ directory within your project structure, or adjust the code paths accordingly.

## 🏃 Usage
* Prepare Data: Ensure your dataset is correctly placed and the paths in the code are updated.Run Training Script:python train.py. This script will load the data, preprocess it, build the model, and start the training process.
* Generate Captions: `python predict.py --image_path` , the image path could be in the format `"path/to/your/image.jpg"`

After training, you can use the predict.py script to generate captions for new images.
