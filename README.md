# CodSoft AI Internship #

Welcome to my **CodSoft Internship** repository!

This repository documents my journey and project work during my **Artificial Intelligence Internship** at CodSoft. It includes real-world AI tasks that helped me explore cutting-edge techniques and build hands-on experience.

## üîß Internship Overview üîß ##

As part of this internship, I was assigned **five key tasks**, covering a range of AI domains including **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**.

Each project reflects a different AI technique and tool aimed at solving practical problems through innovative methods.

## üìå Notes

-Each task is organized into its own dedicated folder (Task-1, Task-2, etc.).

-Inside each folder, you will find:

    -A detailed README.md explaining the task, setup instructions, implementation details, and optional enhancements.

    -The complete source code and any necessary data or models.

-All projects were built using Python 3 and open-source libraries.

Feel free to explore each task individually!
