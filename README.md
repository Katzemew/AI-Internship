# CodSoft AI Internship #

Welcome to my **CodSoft Internship** repository!

This repository documents my journey and project work during my **Artificial Intelligence internship** at CodSoft. It includes real-world AI tasks that helped me explore cutting-edge techniques and build hands-on experience.

## 🔧 Internship Overview 🔧 ##

As part of this internship, I was assigned **five key tasks**, covering a range of AI domains including **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**.

Each project reflects a different AI technique and tool aimed at solving practical problems through innovative methods.
